## Overview 
  In continued work with SellBy, this project focusses on the analysis of Amazon product reviews. The reviews are a component of the Amazon Vine program, a service that allows suppliers of products to recieve reviews written by members of the paid Vine program. Companies can elect to pay a fee to Amazon, and to provide example products to Vine members, who then are required to publish a written review within the Amazon system. 

   ### Purpose
   To prepare a statistical analysis on a chosen Vine review category, downloaded from the Amazon cloud. Using PySpark and working within Colab notebook, and using AWS S3 storage and AWS RDS with a hosted PostgreSQL database, an ETL and transform process was performed on selected data. The analysis was to determine if any favorable bias exists with reviews in the data between Vine-paid reviews versus reviews that were not in the Vine program. 
  
   The deliverables are: 
   - Deliverable 1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews
   - Deliverable 2: Determine Bias of Vine Reviews
   - Deliverable 3: A Written Report on the Analysis (this README.md).

**Questions:**  Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:
  1. How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
  Filters on the data: 1) reviews that had greater than 20 total votes, and 2) reviews where the ratio of helful votes to total votes was greater than 50 percent.
  
  Vine reviews = 
  non-Vine review = 
 
 
  2. How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
 
  Vine reviews quantity = 
  non-Vine reviews quantity = 
 
 
  3. What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
